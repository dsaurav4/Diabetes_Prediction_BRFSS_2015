# Diabetes Prediction Using 2015 BRFSS Data

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook that presents a machine learning project aimed at predicting diabetes using the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. The project focuses on assessing the impact of various demographic and lifestyle factors, such as Body Mass Index (BMI), exercise frequency, and dietary habits, on the likelihood of developing diabetes.

## Overview

The objective of this project was to apply machine learning techniques to understand and predict the risk of diabetes. The notebook covers the entire process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, with an emphasis on the following areas:

- **Data Analysis**: Exploration of the 2015 BRFSS dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to diabetes prevalence.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of logistic regression and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to predict diabetes, aiming to achieve the best possible predictive performance.

- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed evaluation of models using cross-validation and ROC analysis, achieving an approximate accuracy of 75% across different algorithms, thus underscoring their potential in healthcare settings.
